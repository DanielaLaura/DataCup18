# DataCup18-Desjardins
## Building a predictive model from consumer spending habits

Amongst many other businesses, Desjardins has a prominent credit card offering. In fact, it is the 1st largest emitter of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Quebec and the 6th in Canada. This transpired in a business volume of over 35 billion dollars in 2017. With over a million credit card clients, the impact Desjardins has on the financial well-being of individuals, families and communities across the country is consequently immeasurable.

With this in mind, it is important for Desjardins to be constantly improving how it responds to the financial needs of its members and clients. To enable its clients to better manage their credit, Desjardins Card Services would like to implement a behavioural prediction model. This model would analyze a client’s billing, payment and transactional histories and would make a prediction as to whether a client is likely to be delinquent on their payments in the coming year.

Beyond the pure prediction (AUROC) score, the ideal solution would be feasibly deployed to production and would be combined with other internal scores and factors to provide a more complete picture of a client’s financial situation. This solution could eventually influence decisions on how new credit is granted to clients, determine how existing credit is treated and better personalize which products and services are offered.
